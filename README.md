# ConnectedDimensions

Stacks dimensions on top of one another. If you fly up you'll go from
Nether->Overworld->End. Going down goes the other direction. Players will
trigger chunk loading. All other entities will teleport if the destination is
already loaded.

Changed world generation to remove the bedrock from the bottom of the
overworld. The nether generation has more changes, not only to remove the
bedrock ceiling but also to fill the entire build range. It thins out the
higher Y levels because just falling on to the nether roof was just a bit
too boring.
